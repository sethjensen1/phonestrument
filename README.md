# phonestrument
Phonestrument is a project I've been working on with a friend to turn an old conference phone, a Panasonic KX-T7020, into a MIDI controller with a Teensy in USB MIDI mode.
The only part I use from the phone right now is the keypad, which is a 4x10 grid, and comes with convenient pinouts. Around half of the buttons have built-in LEDS, which I may integrate later. Current code only allows for the number keys, pound, and star to work.
